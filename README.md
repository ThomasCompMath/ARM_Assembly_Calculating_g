# Calculating G

Coding practice

Creating a program that can experimentally calculate g

The idea is that the user could drop an object from a height three times, enter those times in, measure the height from which the object was dropped and enter that height in, and then the program will calculate g from the measurements.

This particular project is pedagogical in nature, offering a comparison between possible algorithms at different levels of abstraction.
