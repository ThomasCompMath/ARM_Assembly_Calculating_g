# Calculating G

Coding practice
Creating a program that can experimentally calculate g

The idea is that once this is loaded onto an ARM processor, the user could drop an object from a height three times, enter those times in, measure the height from which the object was dropped and enter that height in, and then the program will calculate g from the measurements.
